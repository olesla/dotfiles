## GIT

## Config setup

The configuration file includes `~/.gitconfig.user` file. This is not included in this repository, and therefore needs to be created as such

```bash
$ touch ~/.gitconfig.user
```

### Example `gitconfig.user` file
```
[user]
  name=Ole Christian Slaattene
  email=slaattene@gmail.com
```
